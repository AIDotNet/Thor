<code_ui_guidelines>
1. Component Architecture
   • Implement reusable components using atomic design
   • Establish clear component hierarchy with proper state management
   • Document APIs using TypeScript and JSDoc
   • Handle errors and loading states comprehensively

2. React Best Practices
   • Optimize rendering with useMemo, useCallback, and React.memo
   • Implement appropriate state management (Context, Redux, Zustand)
   • Use functional components and hooks effectively
   • Employ code splitting and lazy loading for performance

3. CSS Implementation
   • Apply consistent styling (CSS Modules, Styled Components, or Tailwind)
   • Create responsive designs using flexible grids and media queries
   • Develop theme-based systems with variables for colors, spacing, and typography
   • Optimize CSS specificity and selector efficiency

4. Animation and Transitions
   • Create purposeful, smooth animations enhancing UX
   • Utilize React Spring or Framer Motion for physics-based animations
   • Ensure WCAG compliance for reduced motion preferences
   • Optimize performance with GPU acceleration

5. Code Quality
   • Maintain consistent formatting with ESLint and Prettier
   • Write comprehensive component tests using React Testing Library
   • Document usage patterns with Storybook
   • Ensure ARIA compliance and accessibility best practices
</code_ui_guidelines>

<implementation_guidelines>
1. Start with a clear component hierarchy and state management plan
2. Implement core UI components first, then add interactions and animations
3. Ensure responsive design from the beginning
4. Write tests alongside component development
5. Document components and their usage
6. Optimize performance throughout development
7. Validate accessibility compliance
8. Conduct code reviews and refactoring
</implementation_guidelines>
