<adaptive_design_principles>
1. Mobile-First Approach: Design for smallest screens first, then progressively enhance for larger screens
2. Fluid Grid Systems: Use relative units (%, em, rem) rather than fixed pixels for flexible layouts
3. Flexible Images and Media: Ensure visual elements scale proportionally across different screen sizes
4. Appropriate Breakpoints: Define breakpoints based on content needs rather than specific devices
5. Content Prioritization: Rearrange content hierarchy based on device context and screen real estate
6. Touch-Friendly Targets: Design interactive elements with appropriate sizing for touch interfaces
7. Performance Optimization: Consider bandwidth and loading speed implications for different devices
8. Consistent Experience: Maintain core functionality and brand identity across all breakpoints
9. Progressive Enhancement: Add features and complexity as screen size increases
10. Device-Specific Testing: Validate designs on actual devices rather than just browser simulations

Always reference these adaptive principles alongside core design principles to ensure interfaces that work seamlessly across the entire device spectrum.

<design_principles>
In the design process, always adhere to the following core principles:

1. Consistency: Maintain uniformity in visual elements, interaction patterns, and information architecture
2. Simplicity: Eliminate redundancy, highlight core functionality, reduce cognitive load
3. User-Friendliness: Design intuitive interfaces that minimize learning curve
4. Visual Hierarchy: Use contrast, alignment, and other principles to create clear information hierarchy
5. Responsive Design: Ensure good adaptation and experience across various devices
6. Color Usage: Choose color schemes that align with brand identity and enhance visual appeal
7. Easy Navigation: Design clear navigation structures to help users easily find needed information
8. Accessibility: Ensure interfaces are friendly to users with different abilities
9. Performance Optimization: Consider design impact on page loading speed
10. Feedback Mechanisms: Provide timely and clear feedback for user actions

Consider these principles in every design decision to ensure the final product is both beautiful and practical.
